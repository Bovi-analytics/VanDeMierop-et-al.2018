This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for Raf Van De Mierop his master thesis on switching the direction of calve hutches. 

# Data import

```{r}
path <- "./Data.csv"
df.calves <- read.csv2(path)
summary(df.calves)
```

You can already clearly see that some of the variables are obsolete, all are females, so that factor is useless

Some transformations are needed

```{r}
df.calves$HUTCH <- as.factor(df.calves$HUTCH)
df.calves$SAMPLE <- as.factor(df.calves$SAMPLE)
```


# Data exploration

We next need to explore our data of interest visually, namely both CFU samples.

```{r}
hist(df.calves$CORR_SAMPLE,
     main = "Histogram for samples",
     xlab = "CFU")
```

So far it looks like the data is normally distributed when looking at the CFU.

# Influencers of the CFU

NEXT, let's take a look whether the CFU is influenced by some of the measures taken while sampling. For example age of the calve.

## Model building

A [generalised linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model)  is constructed with HUTCH as random effect.

First the baseline model is build, and next [univariate models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate) are constructed for each of the variables.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (!require("lme4")) {
  install.packages("lme4", dependencies = TRUE)
  library(lme4)
}
if (!require("lmerTest")) {
  install.packages("lmerTest", dependencies = TRUE)
  library(lmerTest)
}
if (!require("knitr")) {
  install.packages("knitr", dependencies = TRUE)
  library(knitr)
}
summary(baseline <- lmer(CFU~ 1 +  (1|HUTCH), 
                        df.calves))
```

This is the baseline model which can be subsequently used when adding explanatory variables.

### AGE

```{r}
plot(df.calves$CFU, df.calves$AGE)
summary(glm1 <- lmer(CFU~ AGE +  (1|HUTCH), 
                        df.calves))
anova(baseline, glm1, test = "Chisq")
```

So it can be seen that age is influencing the CFU, but maybe this is due to the bedding?

### BEDDING

```{r}
plot(df.calves$CFU, df.calves$BEDDING)
summary(glm2 <- lmer(CFU~ BEDDING + (1|HUTCH), 
                        df.calves))
anova(baseline, glm2, test = "Chisq")

```

We can see that the bedding is not a significant influencer. 

### SWITCH

What about switching the direction of the hutch.


```{r}
plot(df.calves$CFU, df.calves$SWITCH)
summary(glm3 <- lmer(CFU~ SWITCH + (1|HUTCH), 
                        df.calves))
anova(baseline, glm3, test = "Chisq")
```



And a tendency for an effect of switching the direction of the hutch.

## Final model

Lets build the final model by adding an interaction between both
```{r}
summary(glm4 <- lmer(CFU~ SWITCH * AGE + (1|HUTCH), 
                        df.calves))
anova(baseline, glm4, test = "Chisq")
```

Let's see if we can visualize this effect a bit more niecely.

### Final model plots

```{r}
if (!require("effects")) {
  install.packages("effects", dependencies = TRUE)
  library(effects)
}
if (!require("lsmeans")) {
  install.packages("lsmeans", dependencies = TRUE)
  library(lsmeans)
}
plot(effect("SWITCH:AGE", 
            glm4, 
            #xlevels=list(CALC_ARRIVAL=900:2000), 
            multiline=TRUE),
     main = "Interaction between switching and age",
     xlab = "Age",
     ylab = "CFU")
```
```
